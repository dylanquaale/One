# My-Portfolio

portfolio

## Description

What my plan was for this project is to make a simple easy to navigate portfolio page. That way employers have easy acces to the work I have done. All my tabs to navigate the page are at the top in the header. Followed by my about me section, then to my work section, lastly followed by the footer.
Each section has their own links that you can use to take you to my, linkedin, instagram, twitter,facebook and github pages.
