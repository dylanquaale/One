## Description

What I did is replace some of the div tags with better semantic elements.

<header> <main> alt tags <nav> <section> <aside> <footer>
Header- Showing where the header of page is instead of using a div
Main- Represents the dominant content of the body
Nav- Set of navigation links
Section- Shows section of webpage
Aside- representing my sidebar
Footer- Bottom of the page "Made with ❤️️ by Horiseon"

## Description

Click on links in the header of to navigate around.
